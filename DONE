  - tld ac; add registrant_country

  - email regex use \. in:  "emails": r"[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.[\w]{2,4}"
    this now results in valid data on google.com and meta.com and all derived from .com tld

  - add comment in tld_resgepr.py that emails, status, name_serevers are multi items (lists)
    and all the rest are single results.

  - add comments to beginning of tld_regexpr.py explaining that all matches are actually case insensitive (findall)
    and that many whois responses have trailing whitespace and may end in \r\n
    this helps with constructing regexes for future use

  - add skipFromHere in _2_parse.py: lines starting with ^>>> signify the end of a normal whois response
    after this line there is only human or legal information so we can simply skip that text
    (a similar construct with ^--\s will be done later)

  - add commment that unfortunately we cannot currently use rtrim on input from whois response and may regexes expect
    either \r or trailing whitespace, this can be done later and would make many regexes simpler in end detection
